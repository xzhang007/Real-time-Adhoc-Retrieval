United Kingdom government austerity programme

The Con-Lib austerity programme is the policy of cuts in government spending being carried out by the current Conservative/Liberal-Democrat coalition government of the United Kingdom in order to tackle the UK's budget deficit.

2010
The belief that the government is just a big household is fundamental to the government's plans. It believes that if it balances its budget, the economy will automatically balance, too. That idea will be tested to destruction by the [scale of the] planned [spending cuts] over the parliamentary term.

—Martin Wolf, October 2010[1]
Upon taking office in May, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne set himself the target of reducing the UK's deficit to the point that, in the financial year 2015–16, the total public debt would be falling as a fraction of GDP, set up the Office of Budget Responsibility, and commissioned a government-wide spending review, to conclude in autumn 2010, to set limits on departmental spending until 2014–15.[2][3] He outlined £6.2bn in cuts to take effect before the autumn spending review: "We simply cannot afford to increase public debt at the rate of £3bn each week."[4] A Financial Times editorial agreed.[5] In an open letter to the chancellor, however, the respected FT commentator Martin Wolf wrote: "I have been fascinated—if appalled—by the pre-Keynesian approach you and the prime minister have taken to the UK's fiscal challenges. What Keynes called "the Treasury view"—that fiscal policy has no effect on activity, even in a deep recession—is alive and well in Downing Street."[3] Comparing Coalition austerity measures with the Opposition's, Wolf commented that the "big shift from Labour . . . is the cuts in welfare benefits."[1]

Leaked Treasury documents the next month revealed that Osborne anticipated his tighter spending would lead to 1.3 million jobs lost over the course of the parliament.[6] Osborne has termed those who object to his policy "deficit-deniers".[7]

In September, the IMF described Osborne's deficit reduction plans as "essential", though revised its growth estimate down,[8] and dozens of leading British CEO's publicly declared their support in a high-profile letter.[9] Others were openly hostile to Osborne's plans, notably David Blanchflower and Martin Wolf.[3][10][11] It was also reported in September that the quarterly UK trade deficit for April–June 2010 was the largest since annual records began in 1946.[12] "July's dreadful UK trade figures cast further doubt over the ability of the external sector to drive the recovery once the boost from government and consumer spending fades," commented Vicky Redwood of Capital Economics.[12]

George Osborne, presented the Government's Spending Review on 20 October, which fixed spending budgets for each government department up to 2014–15.[13][14] Before and after becoming chancellor, Osborne had alleged that the UK was on "the verge of bankruptcy".[15][16] When he maintained the stance to justify the Spending Review, Martin Wolf took issue: "The chancellor presents the hypothesis of looming national 'bankruptcy'. If so, the UK must have been bankrupt for much of the past two centuries."[17] A fortnight after his Review presentation, the Treasury Select Committee also accused the chancellor of using inflammatory language to justify the large public spending cuts.[18]

More bad news was to follow as it was reported that UK exports had fallen at a record pace in the fourth quarter of 2010, highlighting the fact that Britain had not escaped a plunge in global trade.[19] Vicky Redwood remarked: "Until the UK's export sector starts to perk up, any recovery in the overall economy seems unlikely."[19] The economy also posted a contraction of 0.5 percent for the final quarter of 2010.[20] Hetal Mehta from Dalwa Capitol described the negative growth as "a horrendous figure. An absolute disaster for the economy. . . . It seems that the economy is incredibly vulnerable. And with the fiscal tightening yet to fully bite, we will have to brace ourselves for a bumpy ride."[20] Osborne said that although the figures were disappointing, there was strong performances and growth from sections of the economy less affected by the weather, such as manufacturing.[20] He also declared that the poor figures and bad weather would not affect implementation of his austerity measures and budget deficit reduction, and that he would not be "blown off course".[20]

2011
2011 ushered in better news, with the revised figures for the month of January indicating that the deficit in trade in goods had narrowed compared to December 2010, and by much more than expected.[21] "This is welcome news for the UK economy and signals a further rebalancing of the economy towards export-led manufacturing growth," said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit Group.[21]

Osborne's policies caused continuing concern as a series of bad data indicated the deteriorating state of the UK economy.[22] Martin Wolf observed: "The release of the preliminary version of the May 2011 Economic Outlook from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development allows the reader to trace the disappointing path that the UK economy has taken",[23] and NIESR, predicting a growth slump, recommended delaying the spending cuts.[24] On 6 June, fifty-two people, including some of Britain's leading economists, two former Whitehall advisers and two signatories of the previous year's high-profile letter backing the Tories' cuts, publicly warned Osborne that the UK was too fragile to withstand his drastic spending cuts and that he must draw up a plan B.[25][26] As in January, Osborne dismissed the criticism.[27] Over the following week, the IMF reaffirmed its support for Osborne's cuts, again describing them as "essential", though again revising its growth prediction down,[28][29] and a number of economists publicly encouraged Osborne not to abandon his deficit-reduction programme.[30] The same week featured a repetition of a threat by Moody's to downgrade the UK's credit rating[31] (a Chinese ratings agency had already downgraded Britain's credit rating because it foresaw years of sluggish growth),[32] contradicting Osborne's claim a few weeks prior that the UK's credit rating had "come off negative outlook ­when other countries are facing downgrades. We have brought much-needed stability at home and attracted near universal confidence abroad".[31][33]

The trade deficit held steady in April and May: "Month-to-month volatility aside, there has been an improvement in the foreign trade data in the last few months," said Alan Clarke, UK economist at Scotia Bank.[34] Economists noted, however, that although export volumes appeared steady, much of the improvement in the trade balance came from weak domestic demand for imports, a sign of belt-tightening.[34] Interviewing former US Treasury secretary, Lawrence Summers, in April, Martin Wolf asked about Osborne's commitment to austerity: "What the Europeans are doing, their insistence on stringency everywhere—both voluntary in the UK, forced elsewhere—do you consider this to be basically nuts?" Summers answered in the affirmative, saying: "I find the idea of expansionary fiscal contraction, in the context of the world in which we now live, to be every bit as oxymoronic as it sounds. And I think the consequences are likely to be very serious for the countries involved. . . . I'm fairly confident that this experiment is not going to work out well."[35] Martin Wolf agreed "completely" with Summers' assessment.[35]

In June it was reported that Osborne's staff had been complaining privately to the BBC about an alleged negative bias in the latter's coverage of the economy, and Osborne aired the accusation publicly in a BBC interview.[36] The BBC rebutted Osborne's comments on its website.[36]

Second-quarter GDP-figures were, with just 0.2% growth, "horribly unimpressive".[37] The Office for National Statistics (ONS) argued the figures were heavily influenced by one-off, suppressing factors,[38] though Lex argued that, "Little weight should be put on" the ONS's claims.[37] Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls accused Osborne of being "breathtakingly complacent",[39] while Malcolm Barr, an economist at JPMorgan, said, "No one can claim that the economy is anything but disappointing".[40] Though the OBR's monthly survey of private sector economists showed progressive downgrades of GDP growth estimates—the July forecast was a 1.3 per cent rate of expansion, down from 1.7 per cent in March[41]—the OBR reported that public finances were on track.[41] Commenting on the low, 0.2% growth of GDP, Osborne, as on previous occasions, stated that, although the economy was carrying some "heavy weights",[41] abandoning his austerity programme "would only risk British jobs and growth."[42] An FT editorial again gave qualified praise for Osborne's performance.[43] In July 2011, IMF researchers published a study of austerity programmes over the past 30 years, concluding that austerity has a negative impact on domestic demand and GDP,[44] while a Cambridge University study, after analysing the explanations of why there had been "no substantive reduction in Britain's current account deficit" despite the improved trading situation produced by the depreciation of the pound, found that the "widely and influentially held" explanation that the problem was a permanent loss of productive capacity—rather than a lack of demand—is based on "surprisingly weak foundations."[45] It is a crucial finding, as a previous study has highlighted, because if the problem is actually lack of demand in the British economy and the problem is not addressed, the persistent slack demand will itself cause a permanent loss of British productive capacity: "This is a message that may be taken from any number of historic studies of banking crises."[45] Roberto Perotti of Bocconi University has also shown that on occasions when austerity and expansion coincide, the coincidence is almost always attributable to rising exports associated with currency depreciation.[46]

Within days, however, bad news emerged for the manufacturing sector, which had been "the economy's stellar performer since the UK emerged from recession".[47] Optimism among manufacturers fell for the first time in two years[47] (shortly thereafter it emerged that manufacturing had contracted in July, the first such decline in more than two years,[48] as British manufacturers fired a broadside at ministers' efforts to "rebalance" the economy);[49] Osborne's plan to offer a national insurance holiday to small companies to boost jobs growth in the UK's regions had had only a "minuscule" take-up since it was launched a year ago;[50] the CBI lowered its growth forecast for 2011 again, but emphasised that the economy was still expected to grow;[51] the IMF, pointing to weak growth prospects, cast doubt on Osborne's ability to meet his 2015–6 goal for eliminating the deficit;[52][53] the head of the OBR stated his belief that the UK would fail to meet its 2011 growth target of 1.7%;[54] leading builders merchants complained that the construction sector's recovery was being held back by Osborne's austerity measures;[55] the IMF estimated that British households would lose £1,500 a year for the next five years as a consequence of the austerity drive,[56] warned that the UK faced a "bumpy and uneven" recovery,[57] and that Osborne should prepare to be flexible;[57] NIESR, in a more outspoken fashion than the IMF, told Osborne that his cuts would lead to the deficit's existence past his 2015–16 target;[58] NIESR and the IMF estimated that the UK's structural unemployment rate would be worse than before the financial crisis;[59] UK car sales continued their uninterrupted fall for each month of Osborne's chancellorship;[60] and, with the Bank of England preparing to slash growth forecasts,[61] Business Secretary Vince Cable warned that the UK was facing the risk of a double-dip recession.[62] The next month, Martin Wolf described Osborne's fiscal policy as being "set on kamikaze tightening".[63] UK industrial output fell 0.6% in November; manufacturing output was also down in the month, by 0.2% following a downwardly-revised 1% fall in the previous month, and meant output was 3.1% lower than a year ago—Philip Shaw, UK economist at fund manager Investec argued, "There isn't very much that's performing well in the UK economy."[64]

Speaking to business leaders at the CBI conference in November, David Cameron said that reducing the deficit was "line one, clause one and part one" of the Coalition's strategy for business,[65] though his stance was criticised.[66] In December 2011, The Economist, in reviewing monetary and fiscal policy in the Great Depression and the late-2000s financial crisis, remarked: "Whatever relative importance is assigned to monetary and fiscal policy, though, there is little doubt that their simultaneous tightening five years into the Depression led to a vicious relapse. Spurred by his treasury secretary, Henry Morgenthau—who worried in 1935 that "we cannot help but be riding for a fall unless we continue to decrease our deficit each year and the budget is balanced"—Roosevelt urged fiscal restraint on Congress in 1937."[46] It also warned that in spite of the IMF's argument that the Bank of England's monetary policy would alleviate the effects of Osborne's austerity programme, "Britain is now close to recession and unemployment is rising, suggesting limits to what a central bank can do."[46]

It was reported in The Independent in December 2011 that Osborne had been involved in meetings[67] with bankers lobbying to avoid proposals in the Vickers Report that were intended to reduce risks in the banking industry.[68] The talks were alleged to be secret, but were obtained via a Freedom of Information request.
