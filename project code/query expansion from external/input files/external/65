Let's Move!

Let's Move! is a campaign to end childhood obesity in the United States. The campaign was started by First Lady Michelle Obama. The initiative has the goal of "solving the challenge of childhood obesity within a generation so that children born today will reach adulthood at a healthy weight."[1]

The campaign was announced on February 9, 2010 by the First Lady. She indicated the campaign would encourage healthier food in schools, better food labeling and more physical activity for children.[2] On the same date, President Barack Obama signed a presidential memorandum creating the Task Force on Childhood Obesity to review current programs and develop a national action plan.

Let's Move! seeks to combat the epidemic of childhood obesity and encourage a healthy lifestyle through "a comprehensive, collaborative, and community-oriented initiative that addresses all of the various factors that lead to childhood obesity [. . .] engaging every sector of society that impacts the health of children to provide schools, families and communities the simple tools they need to help kids be more active, eat better, and get healthy."[3]

Childhood Obesity

Childhood obesity
Body Mass Index (or BMI) is a measurement of weight in relation to height that can help to determine weight status. In children, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (or CDC) determine that a child is overweight if he/she is above the 85th percentile and lower than the 95th percentile and obese if at or above the 95th percentile.[4]

The CDC indicates that there are several factors that can contribute to childhood obesity: genetic factors; behavioral factors including energy intake, physical activity and sedentary behavior; and environmental factors.[5] Overweight and obesity pose many potential risks and consequences: psychological; cardiovascular disease; among additional risks including asthma, hepatic steatosis, sleep apnea, and type 2 diabetes.[6]

The Let’s Move! initiative focuses on reforming of behavioral factors and environmental factors by focusing on active lifestyles and healthy eating through community involvement, including but not limited to schools, parents and healthcare providers.[7]

Healthy Eating
To promote healthy eating, the Let’s Move! initiative focuses on nutrition information, the next generation food pyramid, empowering consumers and having pediatricians as partners.[8] The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has put Dietary Guidelines together to form a food pyramid that can be personalized, which can be located at MyPyramid.gov.[9] This website has made a page just for children so they can become more interested in healthy eating.[10] Let’s Move! also wants to give more power to consumers through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (or FDA)’s “New Front-of-Package Labeling Initiative” and “New Menu and Vending Machines Labeling Requirements.”[11]

Let’s Move! advocates healthy eating habits to be promoted by families, schools, and communities.[12] Let’s Move! urges mothers to eat healthier when pregnant and offers links to a special “MyPyramid Plan for Moms” so they can create a personalized and healthy diet.[13] The initiative also provides guidelines for parents to set-up and promote healthy eating habits for their entire family and children.[14] In order for healthier eating to be promoted at schools, Let’s Move! promotes the USDA’s HealtheirUS School Challenge.[15]

"The HealthierUS School Challenge (HUSSC) is a voluntary initiative established in 2004 to recognize those schools participating in the National School Lunch Program that have created healthier school environments through promotion of nutrition and physical activity.
In February 2010, First Lady Michelle Obama introduced Let’s Move!, incorporating the HealthierUS School Challenge into her campaign to raise a healthier generation of kids. At the time, monetary incentive awards became available for each HUSSC award level: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Gold Award of Distinction."[16]
Physical Activity
The CDC recommends that children engage in one hour or more of physical activity everyday. It states that children should do three different types of activity: aerobic activity, muscle strengthening and bone strengthening.[17]

Let’s Move! looks to promote physical activity through the support and cooperation of families, schools and communities. On children, the initiative states, "Those who feel supported by friends and families or are surrounded by others interested in physical activity, are more likely to participate."[18] Let’s Move! also provides several guidelines for schools to promote physical activity, including strong physical education programs, and indicates the subsidizing of such guidelines with several government programs.[19] Guidelines by which physical activity can be promoted in communities are also outlined on the Let’s Move! website.[20]

Criticism
Republicans and Democrats alike have criticized funding the program by cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program "food stamp" program. The cuts were proposed on the heels of a previous 13.6% cut to the foodstamp program.[21]
