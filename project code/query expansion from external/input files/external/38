2011â€“12 Jordanian protests

Jordan's economy continues to struggle, weighed down by a record deficit of $2bn this year.[1] Inflation in Jordan has risen by 1.5 per cent to 6.1 per cent in December 2010, and unemployment and poverty have become rampant, estimated at 30 and 25 per cent respectively.[1] The government is also accused of impoverishing the working class with regressive tax codes which forced the poor to pay a higher proportion of their income as tax. The parliament is accused of serving as a "rubber stamp" to the executive branch.[1]
