First Lady Fashion: Michelle Obama
Whether she's wearing a casual cardigan or a full-length gown, Mrs. Obama's style is sophisticated, accessible and stunning.

Glamorous Gowns
When attending black-tie affairs and formal events, Mrs. Obama has donned many stunning, figure-flattering looks. Some of her standouts include a one-shouldered ivory gown adorned with silk flowers and crystal embellishments by designer Jason Wu, a strapless purple sequined gown by designer Peter Soronen,

Pretty Patterns
Not every dress the first lady wears is full-length and formal. In fact, Mrs. Obama is often photographed in chic knee-length styles with pretty patterns and fun prints—like a rose-print wrap dress by Diane von Furstenburg, the vibrant Duro Olowu mixed-print dress she wore on The Oprah Show and a blue, gray, white and black print dress from Zero + Maria Cornejo.

Belted Beauty
One accessory the first lady is fond of is a stylish belt, which accentuates her small waist. Mrs. Obama has worn both wide and thin belts with everything from casual J.Crew outfits to chic designer styles, like the white Narciso Rodriquez nylon crepe dress with a collarless Michael Kors coat pictured above.


Bright Colors
Mrs. Obama is not one to shy away from color! Whether she's wearing a bright blue dress by Jason Wu, a pink floral silk jacquard dress by Thakoon or an emerald green silk-chiffon number by Stevie Wonder's wife Kai Milla, America's first lady makes bold look beautiful.


Cardigans
Cardigans seem to be a staple in Mrs. Obama's wardrobe—from simple, solid-colored sweaters to dazzling, embellished styles. Versatile and functional, these classic coverups add sparkle and splashes of color to casual looks.


Full Skirts
Though we've seen her wearing slim silhouettes like sheathes and A-line styles, Mrs. Obama often opts for fuller skirts and dresses with flair. This black Azzedine Alaïa dress, green cap-sleeve pleated dress by Barbara Tfank and black-and-white patterned skirt from Diane von Furstenberg's collection beautifully complement the first lady's figure.


Lots of Yellow
Call it canary, lemon or saffron—however you define the shade, it's clear Mrs. Obama is partial to the color yellow. She has brightened up events in a Jason Wu sheath dress, a bright J.Crew tiered skirt and a metallic silk sheath by Michael Kors.


Chic Comfort
While the first lady has shown how sophisticated she looks in skirts and dresses, she appears equally comfortable in more casual ensembles. While working in the White House garden or traveling with the president, Mrs. Obama often opts for pants and a patterned top.

Cute Coats
During the fall and winter months, wearing a coat can be more than just a way to keep warm—it can also make quite a fashion statement. Mrs. Obama displays her penchant for form and function with her elegant coats, including a white tulle tweed coat by Thakoon, a carmine silk nylon coat from Calvin Klein and a black-and-camel coat by Narciso Rodriguez.


Stunning Suits
Who said business suits have to look boring? Mrs. Obama adds her own twist to the traditional business style in this deep purple dress-and-jacket combination accented by a playful "bow tie," a pretty patterned outfit by Zero + Maria Cornejo and a colorful, feminine skirt suit.
