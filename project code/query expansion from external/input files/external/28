About 2011 Detroit Auto Show
Some say Detroit is officially back in business. Well, the 2011 Detroit Auto Show will be a good indicator of its health. It's the biggest, most prestigious auto show of the year, so if the Big Three want to make a splash with some new products, the Detroit auto show is the place to do it.

So far, the unveil list is short, as both Ford and General Motors are keeping their new products under tight wraps. One Blue Oval product that has been confirmed is the fully redesigned 2012 Ford Escape. Set to go on sale later in 2011, the more carlike Escape will share numerous parts with the Ford Kuga, a crossover sold in Europe.

On the GM side, expect to see the official unveil of the 2012 Chevrolet Camaro Z/28, the supercharged coupe we've been expecting for some time now. On the other side of the performance spectrum, the pint-size Chevrolet Sonic is also expected to arrive as a replacement for the current Aveo. Chrysler has already revealed most of its revamped 2011 lineup, but an SRT Grand Cherokee might find its way to the Detroit show floor.

Imports are still allowed in Detroit, so there will be plenty of foreigners, too. The 2012 Mercedes-Benz SLK is likely to show up, along with the BMW 1 Series M coupe and an as-yet-unnamed vehicle from Porsche. Rest assured, that won't be all, so check back here daily for new updates and complete show coverage starting January 10.
