Justin Bieber and Jon Stewart trading places! LOL!! #tds

Justin Bieber and Jon Stewart Swap Bodies on the 'Daily Show'

Pop idol and talk show host trade places in cute skit

When Justin Bieber turned up behind the desk of the Daily Show last night, his presence immediately triggered some panicked questions from fans of regular host Jon Stewart: Was Jon out sick? Did Comedy Central unceremoniously replace him with the teen idol in the hope of getting bigger ratings?

Well, no. The answer was much weirder — Stewart and Bieber had magically traded bodies! But don't worry: They switched back with the help of a magical skull.
