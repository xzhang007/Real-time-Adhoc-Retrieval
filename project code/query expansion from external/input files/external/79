Yemeni Revolution

The 2011 Yemeni protests followed the initial stages of the 2010–2011 Tunisian uprising and occurred simultaneously with the 2011 Egyptian protests[1] and other mass protests in the Arab world in early 2011. The protests were initially against unemployment, economic conditions[2] and corruption,[3] as well as against the government's proposals to modify the constitution of Yemen. The protestors' demands then escalated to calls for President Ali Abdullah Saleh to resign.

A major demonstration of over 16,000 protestors took place in Sana'a on 27 January.[4] On 2 February, President Saleh announced he would not run for reelection in 2013 and that he would not pass power to his son. Tawakel Karman then also called for a "Day of Rage" on 3 February.[5]

Yemen has one of the lowest Human Development Index ratings in the Arab world.

Yemen is facing conflicts with al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula,[6] as well as a revolt from southern secessionists who want to see the old South Yemen reconstituted. Additionally, there is also a Shia Houthi rebellion in the north of the country that wishes to be separate.


Ali Abdullah Saleh has been president of Yemen for 32 years
Ali Abdullah Saleh has been president of Yemen for more than 30 years,[1] and many believe his son Ahmed Saleh is being groomed to eventually replace him.[7] Almost half of the population of Yemen live on $2 or less a day, and one-third suffer from chronic hunger.[8] Yemen ranks #146 in the Transparency International 2010 Corruption Perceptions Index,[9] and #15 in the 2010 Failed States Index.[10]

A draft amendment to the constitution of Yemen is currently under discussion in parliament despite opposition protests. The amendment seeks to allow Saleh to remain in the office of president for life. He urged the opposition to take part in an election on April 27 to avoid "political suicide."

The current parliament's mandate was extended by two years after an agreement in February 2009 agreement the ruling General People's Congress and opposition parties seeking a dialogue on political reforms such as: moving from a presidential system to a proportional representation parliamentary system and a more decentralised. Neither measure has not been implemented.[11]

Use of pink
Main article: Colour revolution
Yemeni protesters wore pink ribbons to symbolise the "Jasmine Revolution" and indicate their non-violent intent.[8] Shawki al-Qadi, a lawmaker and opposition figure, said pink was chosen to represent love and to signal that the protests would be peaceful.[12] The preponderance of pink ribbons in the demonstrations showed the level of planning that went into the protests.[

Thousands of Yemenis protested the streets of Sana'a since mid-January 2011[2][11][13] to demand a change in government,[14] though the protests in the south of the country were more aggressive.[14] The protests "appeared to be the first large-scale challenge" to President Ali Abdullah Saleh's rule;[15] protesters compared him to the ousted Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, citing government corruption[3] and the poor economy of Yemen.[15] Protests occurred in many towns in both the north and south of Yemen initially against Yemeni governmental proposals to modify the constitution of Yemen, rejecting the proposals as insufficient, and over unemployment and economic conditions.[2] Protests on 20 January included thousands of protestors in Ta'izz.[2] Protests in Aden took place on 18, 19[13] and 20 January.[2] In Aden, car tires were burnt, roads were blocked, and at least seven people, both soldiers and protestors, were injured.[13] Protests in Sanaa appeared to be weakening as of 20 January 2011.[2] Two of the protests occurred at Sanaa University, with a slogan "Leave before you are forced to leave", which Reuters interpreted as a criticism of "autocratic Arab leaders, including Saleh."[2]

Since 27 January
At least 16,000 demonstrators took to the streets in Sanaa on 27 January,[4] including at least 10,000 at Sanaa University.[4]

After the government announced intentions for political reforms, protesters rejected the proposals as not extensive enough to ensure Saleh or his son do not continue to rule indefinitely.[16] Protesters appeared to be pushing for reform rather than a revolution unlike in Tunisia.[17] A Yemeni journalist stated: "These were not spontaneous or popular protests like in Egypt, but rather mass-rallies organised by the opposition who are using events in Tunisia to test Saleh's regime. This is only the start of a fierce political battle in the run-up to Yemen's parliamentary elections in April."[8]

On 29 January, protesters in Sanaa demanded the ouster of Saleh. They chanted "Ali, leave leave" and "Tunisia left, Egypt after it and Yemen in the coming future" before plainclothes police officers attacked the demonstration, though no casualties were reported. Tawakel Karman, a leading parliamentary member of the Al-Islah, said a security force personnel tried to attack her with a dagger and a shoe but protesters stopped him. She also said that "We will continue until the fall of Ali Abdullah Saleh's regime. We have the Southern Movement in the south, the (Shia) Huthi rebels in the north, and parliamentary opposition [calling for political change]."

3 February – "Day of Rage"
Karman called for 3 February to be a "Day of Rage."[5] According to Xinhua News, organisers are calling for a million protesters to participate in the demonstration in Sana'a.[18] The day before, the Interior Ministry stated that it was increasing security prior to the planned protests in order to prevent weapons from being introduced and "suspects" from entering major cities.[18]

Up to 20,000 protesters were reported to be demonstrating in Sanaa,[19] though "tens of thousands" of pro-government supporters also converged on the site forcing a change of venue.[20][21] A protest in Aden was broken up by security services who reportedly fired tear gas and even live ammunition. Mohammed al-Sabri of the Common Forum called Saleh's attempt to halt protests "unacceptable;" though he also said that his group would "discuss the president's announcement."[22]

Opposition strategies
Students and human rights activists disagree with political parties regarding tactics for political change in Yemen. Some political parties are calling for reform to take place under President Saleh, while students and human rights activists wish to "channel the momentum of the uprisings in the region."[23] A lawyer and human rights activist involved in organising protests, Khaled al-Anesi, stated "There is a popular movement and a political movement in Yemen. But there is no support from the political parties for the popular movement, which is not organised. It is still weak and in the beginning stages."[23]

Arrests and repression
On 23 January, Tawakel Karman was detained and changed with "'inciting disorder and chaos' and organising unauthorised demonstrations and marches".[24] Karman was a leader of two student rallies in Sana'a and called for the overthrow of Saleh's regime.[11] Her husband said her whereabouts were not known.[11] Several hundred students protested outside Sanaa University demanding her release.[11] Thousands of people protested against the arrest of Karman and other protestors by a sit-in outside of the prosecutor's office. She was freed 30 hours after her arrest on parole, with the condition not to violate "public order and the law".[24] Karman returned to participating in demonstrations hours after her release.[24]

The Committee to Protect Journalists said Yemeni journalists are facing increasing harassment.[25]

Other instability
Southern secessionist groups said they were holding three Yemeni soldiers kidnapped towards the end of January. On 2 February, clashes in the south also resulted in 3 injuries.[26]

Reactions
Domestic
On February 2, President Ali Abdullah Saleh said that he would freeze the constitutional amendment process under way. He also vowed not to pass on the reins of power to his son: "No extension, no inheritance, no resetting the clock;"[27] and that he would quit in 2013.[28] He also called for national unity government.[29]

Yemeni Interior Minister Mutaher al-Masri said that "Yemen is not like Tunisia."[30]

The leader of the Yemeni Congregation for Reform, the largest opposition party in Yemen, Mohammed al-Sabry, stated, "We want constitutional amendments but we want amendments that don't lead to the continuance of the ruler and the inheritance of power to his children."[2] He also doubted Saleh's pledge not to seek re-election. Al-Sabry said Saleh made a promise in 2006 not to run, but then failed to fulfill his pledge.[31]

International
United States During a trip to Yemen Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she was would be working not just at military cooperation but also a "comprehensive strategy" aimed at resolving Yemen's "myriad problems." She also said that "Yemen recognises the threat AQAP poses to it and it has become increasingly committed to a broad-based counter-terrorism strategy. At the same time, we are committed to a balanced approach towards Yemen which includes social, economic and political assistance. We face a common threat by the terrorists in Al-Qaeda. We are focused not just on short-term threats but on long-term challenges." She also signaled a "joint vision for a unified, stable, democratic and prosperous Yemen where civil society had the room to operate and Al-Qaeda did not."[32] US State Department spokesman Philip Crowley told reporters that the US government backs the right of Yemenis to "express themselves and assemble freely".[33] The US also later said that it had hopes reform attempts to stave off protests similar to Egypt.[34]
Prior the outbreak of protests in the Arab world, in December 2009, United States diplomat Angie Bryan claimed that there was opposition to Saleh from his closest advisors. Bryan wrote, "Like other Saleh watchers, xxxxx[35] characterizes the multitude of threats facing Saleh as qualitatively different and more threatening to the regime's stability than those during any other time in Yemen's history. 'Saleh is overwhelmed, exhausted by the war, and more and more intolerant of internal criticism. Saudi involvement comes at just the right time for him' xxxxx said. Largely unprecedented criticism of Saleh's leadership within the rarified circle of Saleh's closest advisors has increased in recent months, even including longtime Saleh loyalists such as Office of the Presidency aides xxxxx, according to xxxxx. These names add to the growing chorus of Saleh loyalists that have shed their traditional aversion to disparaging the man they call 'The Boss'".[36]

On 2 February, brent crude crossed US$100 on concern over instability.[37] The following day, crude oil rose for the fifth day in a row on speculation of spreading protests and the prospect of uncertainty.[38]
