She never got over her stagefright: White Stripes split after founder Meg fails to conquer her gig anxiety

Groundbreaking blues rock duo The White Stripes have announced they've split up after 13 years together. 
The band, comprising of Jack White and ex-wife Meg White released a statement saying they 'will make no further new recordings or perform live.'
They added that there were a 'myriad of reasons' for the breakup, but the main reason was to 'preserve what is beautiful and special about the band.'

The statement continued: 'The reason is not due to artistic differences or lack of wanting to continue, nor any health issues as both Meg and Jack [White] are feeling fine and in good health.'
However, it's thought that Meg's inability to conquer her crippling stage fright led to the pair's decision to dissolve their hugely-successful partnership.

The band cancelled a host of live shows in 2007 and haven't appeared live since. Jack has since concentrated his energies on two other bands, The Raconteurs, and The Dead Weather.
The Dead Weather also features Alison Mosshart from The Kills, the band she created with Kate Moss's boyfriend Jamie Hince.
Last year, Jack, who is married to British supermodel Karen Elson, had seemed hopeful that the band would get back together after their three-year hiatus when Meg appeared to turn a corner.

He said at the time: 'I don’t think her anxiety exists anymore, but I don’t know.
'She was there when we were rehearsing for The Dead Weather, and (my wife) Karen Elson’s band was rehearsing in the next building… She is still involved and everything.'
However, Meg still hadn't played on stage since the Stripes cancelled their tour in September 2007. 
Jack concluded that he was 'hopeful' the band would be revived

Now it appears that the band's last recording will be their live album Under The Great White Northern Lights, which was released last year.
However, in a sweet postscript to fans, the band posted on the official White Stripes website saying: 'The White Stripes do not belong to Meg and Jack anymore.
'The White Stripes belongs to you now and you can do with it whatever you want. The beauty of art and music is that it can last forever if people want it to.'
They also explained that any future unreleased material would be put out by Jack's record label, Third Man Records.
