Keith Olbermann's New Job Is...

Keith Olbermann knows how to get people talking - and tweeting!

The former MSNBC Countdown host is set to announce his next big move, according to a tweet earlier today by Yahoo's Michael Calderone.

Reportedly, he and his "new partners will make an exciting announcement regarding the next chapter" of his career. His publicist confirmed the big announcement as well.

And, now the speculation and anticipation is building via Olbermann's Twitter account (below):

Here's the latest!  Some of hot off the keyboard tweets (above) include Olbermann joking about being signed by the Yankees as well as confirming tomorrow's announcement is NOT on ESPN -- like the famous LeBron James event.

The most entertaining tweet so far sends us to this link where there is an actual 'Announcement Countdown Clock.'

You gotta love it!

Where do you think Keith Olbermann will be taking his talents? Certainly not to Fox News!

UPDATE:
According to a just-released NY Times report, it looks like the winner in the Olbermann lottery is Current TV.

Thoughts?
