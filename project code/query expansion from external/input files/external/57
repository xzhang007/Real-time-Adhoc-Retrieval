January 31 – February 2, 2011 North American blizzard

The January 31–February 2, 2011 North American winter storm, is an ongoing major winter storm, situated around the US and Canadian holiday Groundhog Day. In the initial stages of the storm, some meteorologists predicted that the system would affect over 100 million people in the United States.[1][2] The storm brought cold air, blowing snow and mixed precipitation on a path from New Mexico and northern Texas to New England and Eastern Canada. In Chicago, winds ahead of the storm exceeded 30 mph (48 km/h) and snowfall forecasts were in excess of 24 in (61 cm) for much of Illinois.[3] Blizzard conditions affected many large cities along the storm's path, including Kansas City, St. Louis, Springfield, Chicago, Des Moines, Milwaukee, Detroit, New York City, and Boston.

An ice storm ahead of the winter storm's warm front also brought hazardous conditions to much of the American Midwest and New England, as many areas were expected to receive well over 1 in (2.5 cm) of ice accumulation.[4][5] Numerous power outages, flight cancellations, airport closures and pre-emptive bus and school cancellations took place ahead of the main storm. Several tornado touchdowns were reported in Texas[6] and a tornado watch was issued for parts of Alabama,[7] ahead of the cold front in the warm sector of the storm. In addition, thundersnow was recorded at some locations, increasing the overall snowfall rate.[8]

By the end of January, an Alberta Clipper containing cold air from the polar vortex drifted across The Dakotas, while a large Arctic high pressure system with a maximum pressure higher than 1,050 millibars (31 inHg) followed behind it, moving across Montana. A low pressure system from the Pacific Ocean later crossed the Rocky Mountains, merging with the Alberta Clipper low and a developing Texas low drawing moisture from the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. The storm later intensified, developing a long warm front stretching toward the New England states, and moving northeast along this jet stream track. Lake effect snow events started over Lake Ontario and Lake Michigan from northeasterly winds. Following the predominant jet pattern, the storm developed a very rapid forward trajectory and began to migrate toward the lower Great Lakes.

Storm effects
The storm dropped heavy accumulations of snow, freezing rain, sleet, rain and thunderstorms.

Snow and blizzards
The heaviest snow fell in a wide swath from central Oklahoma to Illinois, Indiana and the Ohio Valley. An official blizzard warning was issued in Southern Ontario for the first time since 1993, although the Canadian definition changed in 2009.[9]

Freezing rain
New York City received almost an inch of ice from freezing rain during the night of 1–2 February, causing public transportation on both bus routes and the Long Island Rail Road to be either delayed or curtailed entirely.[10] Baltimore received freezing rain during the day on 1 February, which was expected to change to rain as temperatures rose on 2 February, and the overall icing in that region was less than expected.[11]

Winds
Strong gale-force winds were expected in many areas, especially places northwest of the Appalachian Mountains.

Flash freeze
Parts of Texas and Louisiana east to the Mississippi Valley and Florida Panhandle experienced or were to experience rapid drops in temperature and flash freeze events after the squall line moved through.

Storm surge
Localized flooding was expected to occur in northeastern Illinois, near the coast of Lake Michigan where strong winds could bring high storm surge and lakeshore flooding. Wind gusts up to 60 mph (97 km/h) are expected to create waves up to 25 25 ft (7.6 m) to areas in the Chicago Metropolitan Area.

Thunderstorms
Severe thunderstorms erupted in many areas of the Midwest and Southeastern United States. Thunderstorms accompanied both heavy rain and snow.

Tornadoes
Tornadoes were reported in Texas,[6] and a tornado watch was issued for parts of Alabama.[7]

In Chicago, in anticipation of the imminent blizzard conditions, 1,300 flights were canceled at O'Hare and Midway airports.[12] By 4:30pm, CST (22:30 GMT), the storm reached blizzard status with sustained winds exceeding 35 miles per hour (56 km/h), with white-out conditions being reported by spotters in the Old Town neighborhood on the city's North Side.[13] The Chicago Public Schools announced, on February 1, that public schools would be closed on the following day (Wednesday, February 2), which marked the first cancellation of classes district wide since the Blizzard of 1999. [14] Heavy snow and high sustained winds gusting in excess of 50 miles per hour (80 km/h), caused rail switches to freeze on the CTA's Red Line and blew portion of the roof off Wrigley Field.[15][16] The University of Chicago also canceled classes Wednesday for the first time in over 60 years due to the snow conditions.[citation needed] Over 39,000 state workers were ordered not to come into work due to the weather; this was the largest figure since a blizzard in 1978.[17]

In the central part of the state, several municipalities were all but shut down by the storm. On Monday, residents rushed to the stores to stock up on groceries, and several stores reported record sales.[18] On Tuesday, several school districts and universities pre-emptively cancelled classes for Tuesday evening and all-day Wednesday. [19] About 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) of snow fell Monday night. [20] Tuesday afternoon brought heavy snowfall and sustained 40 miles per hour (64 km/h) winds, with gusts of over 50 miles per hour (80 km/h). Local government officials encouraged all businesses to close down, and local hospitals braced for the storm by preparing living and sleeping areas for essential personnel.[21][22] Flights from area airports were canceled, and local officials repeatedly urged residents not to travel, as due to the whiteout conditions, snow plows had been taken off the roads.[23][22] Interstate 80 was closed Tuesday night between Morris and Princeton, while Lake Shore Drive was temporarily shut down due to impassible conditions.[24] On Wednesday, Interstate 290 and Illinois Route 53 were shut down from Lake Cook Road in Arlington Heights to St. Charles Road in Elmhurst. 40 vehicles were abandoned on Route 53. Parts of Interstate 57 were also shut down. The state police described most expressways as "impassable".[25][26] During the storm's peak on Tuesday night, more than 100,000 customers were without power across the state, including 79,000 ComEd customers across Northern Illinois and 35,800 Ameren customers in Downstate Illinois.[27] Several charities set up shelters for the homeless and those stranded by the blizzard, [28] and Illinois governor Pat Quinn mobilized 500 Illinois National Guard troops to help rescue stranded motorists. [29] Hundreds of motorists had been rescued off Interstates 290, 55, 57, and 80. In addition, over 80 traffic accidents were reported.[30]

So far, three snow-related deaths have occurred. A fatality occurred when an individual along the lakefront path was blown into the lake under strong winds, and killed. The body has been recovered. In Lyons, a man died while shoveling snow, while a man died while driving through the storm in Grayslake.[31]

20.2 inches of snow fell at Chicago-O'Hare International Airport, making this the third largest snowfall in Chicago history[32], after the infamous Chicago Blizzard of 1967, and the Blizzard of 1999. Additional official snowfall totals included 20.9 inches at Chicago-Midway International Airport, 16.4 inches at the National Weather Service office in Romeoville, and 14.3 inches at Chicago Rockford International Airport.[33] The storm's highest total of 22 inches was reported in northwest suburban Elk Grove Village, just west of O'Hare Airport.[34]

Missouri
In Missouri, a state of emergency has been declared by Governor Jay Nixon and has activated the Missouri National Guard.[35] Interstate 70, which runs east/west for the entire length of Missouri was closed by the Missouri Department of Transportation from Wentzville to Kansas City, nearly 3/4 of the length of the interstate that runs through Missouri [2].

Oklahoma
The heavy snowfall, along with sleet and some freezing rain, began developing over Oklahoma and the Texas panhandle on the evening of January 31, with a state of emergency declared by Governor Mary Fallin earlier that day.[36] As a result, a state law prohibiting price increases of more than 10 percent on most goods and services during and for 30 days after an emergency declaration went into effect, and will remain in effect for 180 days after the declaration order for prices of repairs, remodeling and construction. The Salvation Army of Central Oklahoma opened three shelters and one warming station for those stranded by the storm outdoors, the homeless, and those who lost power during the storm; two in Oklahoma City, one in Norman and one in El Reno, with teams from the Oklahoma chapter of the American Red Cross placed on standby.[37] Will Rogers World Airport and Tulsa International Airport were both closed due to the winter storm as many flights scheduled to arrive at those two airports were cancelled; I-44 from Stroud to the Missouri state line, Interstate 40 near Okemah and westbound lanes of I-40 east of Henryetta were among many major highways closed, and the Indian Nation, Creek and Muskogee turnpikes were all either closed entirely or in stretches. A 20-year-old Oklahoma City woman died due to injuries suffered in a sledding accident near Lake Stanley Draper, in which the sled being pulled by a vehicle veered off the road, flinging the woman into a guardrail; she was pronounced dead at the scene.[38]

Most school districts in the state including the Oklahoma City and Tulsa public school districts, as well as most Oklahoma City government offices were shut down a day in advance of the storm. The U.S. Postal Service released a statement saying that it was attempting to make deliveries across the state but that "some areas may be undeliverable", due to the heavy snow and very low visibility; mail delivery in Oklahoma City did not occur in most areas due to the conditions.[39] Temperatures across the state on February 1st and 2nd hovered in the single digits to mid-teens. Winds gusted to near 60 miles per hour (97 km/h) at times creating ground blizzard conditions across the eastern half of the state; wind chill values dropped as low as −36 °F (−38 °C) in Boise City, the lowest recorded wind chill in the state since the deployment of the Oklahoma Mesonet.[40]

Will Rogers World Airport recorded an estimated 11.6 inches of snow, smashed the all-time daily snowfall record for the month of February for Oklahoma City (the previous record was 6.5 inches on February 7, 1986).[38] Tulsa also set an all-time snowfall record for the storm for February 1 and the month of February, as the Tulsa International Airport received 14 inches of accumulated snowfall (the previous Ferbuary snowfall record for the city of Tulsa was 10.5 inches in February 2003, and the previous record for snowfall in a single 24-hour period in Tulsa was 12.9 inches on March 8-9, 1994).[41] Heavy snow caved in the roof of a bulding on the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino complex in Tulsa containing a poker room and electronic casino games, the damage was confined to an area that was part of the original structure built in 1992. There was no one injured as a result of the roof collapse as no people were in the affected area at the time; the hotel towers, a concert venue, a convention center, and retail operations at the complex were unaffected and remained open.[42] Tulsa's daily newspaper, the Tulsa World, did not release print editions of its February 1st and 2nd editions, due to the storm hampering normal delivery.[43]

State Insurance Commissioner John Doak issued an emergency order to allow licensed claims adjustors outside of Oklahoma to help assess damages and losses from the storm for 90 days.[44] Governor Fallin asked the White House to approve an emergency disaster declaration request for all 77 Oklahoma counties. In a statement by Fallin, state and local governments would receive 75% reimbursement for expenses associated with responding to the storm if the declaration is approved, including overtime costs, costs associated with operating shelters and clearing snow and ice-covered roads.[45]

Wisconsin
In Wisconsin, Governor Scott Walker declared a State of Emergency in 29 Wisconsin counties due to the snowstorm and deployed 75 Wisconsin National Guard soldiers.[46] Nearly all government buildings, schools, and public facilities were closed for February 2, 2011 in the Southeastern region of the state, including the Major cities of Milwaukee and Madison.

Michigan
A 73-year-old Danville man was killed in a vehicle crash.[47]

States of emergency
A state of emergency was declared in several American states, including Oklahoma and Missouri.[48]

Preparations
Local governments ahead of the storm prepared residents on procedures to follow during the storm. This included parking and driving restrictions and preparation of road clearing equipment. Street clearing crews applied chemicals to the roadways to pre-melt ice and snow and checked equipment prior to the event.[49]


In Tulsa, the storm set an all-time snowfall record.[50]
Airport traffic
At least 6,400 flight cancellations occurred across North America before the storm.[51][52][53][54][55][56][57] Impact was severe at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, as over 1,100 flights were cancelled there. A less severe but still a major impact was at Toronto Pearson International Airport in Toronto where about 300 of its 1,400 daily flights were cancelled.[58]

Schools
Numerous school closures were made and were expected.[59][60][61]

Power outages
Many local and widespread power outages affected locations along the storm track, including in Ohio,[62][63][64] Oklahoma,[65] New Mexico,[66] Indiana,[67] Texas,[68] Colorado[69] and Kentucky.[64]

Super Bowl
The severe ice storm also affected the Dallas-Fort Worth area, bringing a coating of ice to the ground after a rapid freeze. This caused some damage ahead of Super Bowl XLV.[70][71][72]
