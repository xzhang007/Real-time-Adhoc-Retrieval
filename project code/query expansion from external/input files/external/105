The Avengers (2012 film)

The Avengers is the title planned for an American superhero film yet to be produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures.[1] It was announced in April 2005 and is to be based upon the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name. The film is intended to be part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe which crosses over several Marvel superhero films including Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger. Chris Evans, Robert Downey, Jr., Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo are under contract to star, with Joss Whedon attached to direct a script written by Zak Penn and Whedon himself. The Avengers has an announced release date of May 4, 2012 in 3-D.[2][3]

Development
Marvel Studios chair-CEO Avi Arad first announced plans to develop an Avengers film in April 2005 after Marvel Enterprises declared independence by pacting with Merrill Lynch to produce a slate of films that will be distributed by Paramount Pictures.[4] In September 2006 Marvel confirmed their crossover plans in a brief presentation to Wall Street analysts. The studio's plan was to release individual films for the main characters, to establish their identities and familiarize audiences with them, before merging the characters together in an Avengers movie.[5] Marvel Studios announced in July 2007 that screen writer Zak Penn who wrote The Incredible Hulk had been hired to write the film and will be titled, The Avengers.[6] Penn confirmed his involvement but said he did not believe work would begin soon.[7]

In January 2008, Marvel struck a deal with the striking Writers Guild of America so that the company could go back to work on films based on its comic book characters, including Captain America, Ant-Man and The Avengers.[8] After the successful release of Iron Man in May, Marvel announced that The Avengers is scheduled for release in July 2011.[9] In September Paramount signed an agreement with Marvel Studios that locks Paramount in as the worldwide distributor of Marvel's next five self-produced feature films. The partnership extended a 2005 agreement that saw Paramount agreeing to distribute as many as 10 Marvel films.[10] In October it was announced that Robert Downey, Jr. and Don Cheadle would reprise their Iron Man 2 roles as Iron Man and War Machine respectively in The Avengers. It was also announced that Jon Favreau will executive produce the film.[11] Also in October, Marvel Studios signed a long-term lease with Raleigh Studios to film four big-budget movies at Raleigh's Manhattan Beach, California complex. The films are Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger and The Avengers.[12] Lou Ferrigno, who voiced Hulk in 2008's The Incredible Hulk, stated that he would be involved in the film.[13]

In February 2009, it was reported that Samuel L. Jackson had made a deal with Marvel Entertainment to play the role of Nick Fury in The Avengers, and potentially many other films.[14] In March it was reported that Scarlett Johansson had replaced Emily Blunt in Iron Man 2, a deal that also tied her to The Avengers.[15] The following day Marvel announced that the release date for The Avengers had been pushed back to May 4, 2012, almost a full year later.[16] In June, Marvel's president of production Kevin Feige confirmed that Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston would reprise their roles as Thor and Loki, respectively, in The Avengers.[17]

In July screenwriter Zak Penn talked about the crossover process, stating, "My job is to kind of shuttle between the different movies and make sure that finally we’re mimicking that comic book structure where all of these movies are connected... There's just a board that tracks 'Here’s where everything that happens in this movie overlaps with that movie'... I'm pushing them to do as many animatics as possible to animate the movie, to draw boards so that we’re all working off the same visual ideas. But the exigencies of production take first priority".[18] The following month, Marvel Studios chief Kevin Fiege stated he would introduce more characters into The Avengers and that the Hulk would factor in the film.[19] In September, Edward Norton stated that he was open to returning as The Hulk for The Avengers.[20] The next month, executive producer Jon Favreau stated that he would not direct the film but will "...definitely have input and a say". Favreau also expressed concerns stating, "It's going to be hard, because I was so involved in creating the world of Iron Man and Iron Man is very much a tech-based hero, and then with 'Avengers' you're going to be introducing some supernatural aspects because of Thor. ... [Mixing] the two of those works very well in the comic books, but it's going to take a lot of thoughtfulness to make that all work and not blow the reality that we've created".[21]

In January 2010, Kevin Fiege was asked if it will be difficult to meld the fantasy of Thor with the high-tech science fiction in Iron Man and The Avengers. "No," he said, "because we're doing the Jack Kirby/Stan Lee/Walt Simonson/J. Michael Straczynski 'Thor.' We're not doing the blow-the-dust-off-of-the-old-Norse-book-in-your-library 'Thor.' And in the 'Thor' of the Marvel Universe, there's a race called the Asgardians. And we're linked through this Tree of Life that we're unaware of. It's real science, but we don't know about it yet. The 'Thor' movie is about teaching people that".[22] In March it was reported that Zak Penn had completed the first draft of the script, and that Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada and Avengers comic-book writer Brian Michael Bendis had received copies.[23] Also in March it was reported that Chris Evans would reprise the role of Captain America in The Avengers.[24] On April 1, 2010, it was reported that Joss Whedon was a leading contender in line to direct The Avengers leading to speculation that it was an April Fools' Day joke.[25] However, later that month, Variety reported that Whedon was close to completing a deal to direct the film, and to rework Penn's script.[2]

Pre-production

At the 2010 Wizard World convention Avengers creator Stan Lee and Marvel Studios CEO Avi Arad confirmed Joss Whedon's involvement.[26] Arad praised the decision by stating, "My personal opinion is that Joss will do a fantastic job. He loves these characters and is a fantastic writer... It's part of his life so you know he is going to protect it... I expect someone like him is going to make the script even better".[27]

In June 2010, it was reported that Jeremy Renner was in final negotiations to play Hawkeye in the film.[28]

In July 2010, HitFix reported that Edward Norton is not returning as Bruce Banner in the film and the studio will cast an unknown to play Bruce Banner.[29] The next day Kevin Feige confirmed the report stating, "We have made the decision to not bring Ed Norton back to portray the title role of Bruce Banner in The Avengers. Our decision is definitely not one based on monetary factors, but instead rooted in the need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members. The Avengers demands players who thrive working as part of an ensemble, as evidenced by Robert, Chris H, Chris E, Sam, Scarlett, and all of our talented casts. We are looking to announce a name actor who fulfills these requirements, and is passionate about the iconic role in the coming weeks."[30] In response Norton's agent Brian Swardstrom called Feige's statement "purposefully misleading" and an "inappropriate attempt to paint our client in a negative light".[31]

Joss Whedon announced at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International that he is directing The Avengers. Whedon mentioned that he was a fan of the early Avengers comics while growing up.[32] He also said he is still writing an outline for the film and that what drew him to the movie is that he loves how "these people shouldn't be in the same room let alone on the same team — and that is the definition of family".[33] Whedon also confirmed that Jeremy Renner would play Hawkeye.[34] It was reported during the convention that Mark Ruffalo would replace Edward Norton as Bruce Banner in a deal reached by Ruffalo's agency with Marvel.[35] During the Marvel Studios panel, it was announced Clark Gregg would reprise his role as S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Phil Coulson.[36]

In August 2010, it was reported that Paramount Pictures and Marvel Studios are planning to start shooting in February.[37] It was also reported that the film will be shot in 3-D.[3]

In October 2010, it was reported that Marvel Studios will shoot The Avengers at Grumman Studios in Bethpage, New York,[38] and at Steiner Studios in Brooklyn, New York City.[39] Set construction is slated to begin in November and Grumman Studios President Parviz Farahzad said the production is expected to use the facility for months.[38] Also in October, The Walt Disney Company agreed to pay Paramount at least $115 million for the worldwide distribution rights to Iron Man 3 and The Avengers.[40]

In December 2010, New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson and Marvel Studios Co-President Louis D'Esposito announced that The Avengers will film primarily in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with principal photography scheduled for April through September 2011. Parts of the film will also be shot in New York and Michigan.[41]

Don Cheadle revealed in a January 2011 interview that he will not be appearing in The Avengers despite previous reports.[42] In February 2011, Marvel began conducting screen tests for the role of a key member of S.H.I.E.L.D. who Samuel L. Jackson described as Nick Fury's sidekick. Morena Baccarin, Jessica Lucas, Cobie Smulders and Mary Elizabeth Winstead were reported to be on the short list of actresses vying for the part.[43]

Planned cast

Cast of The Avengers at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, with Joss Whedon and Kevin Feige.
Chris Evans has been cast as Steve Rogers / Captain America as part of a deal to star in three Marvel films, in addition to The Avengers.[24] In an interview Evans stated he did not know whether or not Captain America would lead the superhero team; "I don't know if they're going to make him the boss. Does he [run the show]? I don't think anybody tells Downey what to do, and that's what makes [him] Downey".[44]

Robert Downey, Jr. is slated to reprise his role of Tony Stark / Iron Man. He was cast as part of his four-picture deal with Marvel Studios, which includes Iron Man 2 and The Avengers.[11] In a 2008 interview with MTV News Downey, Jr. spoke about the fans' high anticipation for the film stating, "That means if we don't get it right, it's really going to suck. It has to be the crowning blow of Marvel's best and brightest, because it's the hardest thing to get right. It's tough to spin all the plates for one of these characters". He also expressed concerns about the project, saying, "The danger you run with colliding all these worlds is that Jon was very certain that Iron Man should be set in a very realistic way. Nothing that happened in Iron Man is really outside the realm of possibility. Once you start talking about Valhalla and supersized super soldiers and jolly green giants, it warrants much further discussion."[45]

Chris Hemsworth is being cast as Thor as part of a multiple movie deal.[17] He had previously worked with Joss Whedon on The Cabin in the Woods.[46] Hemsworth stated that he was able to maintain the strength he built up for Thor by increasing his food intake, consisting of a number of chicken breasts, fish, steak and eggs a day. When asked exactly how much Hemsworth joked, "My body weight in protein pretty much"![47]

Mark Ruffalo was cast as Bruce Banner / the Hulk after negotiations between Marvel and Edward Norton broke down.[35] About replacing Edward Norton, Ruffalo stated, "I'm a friend of Ed's, and yeah, that wasn't a great way for all that to go down. But the way I see it is that Ed has bequeathed this part to me. I look at it as my generation’s Hamlet". About the character he stated, "He's a guy struggling with two sides of himself — the dark and the light — and everything he does in his life is filtered through issues of control. I grew up on the Bill Bixby TV series, which I thought was a really nuanced and real human way to look at The Hulk. I like that the part has those qualities".[48] Ruffalo also told New York magazine that unlike previous incarnations he will actually play the Hulk, "I'm really excited. No one's ever played the Hulk exactly, they've always done CGI. They're going to do the Avatar stop-action, stop-motion capture. So I'll actually play the Hulk. That'll be fun".[49] Lou Ferrigno will voice the Hulk.[13][50]

Samuel L. Jackson has been brought to the project as Nick Fury, with his deal containing an option to play the character in up to nine future Marvel superhero films, which efforts are expected to include Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, The Avengers and The Shield as well as potential sequels.[14] At a press junket for the film Mother and Child, Jackson told reporters that The Avengers will be a starring vehicle for his character, Nick Fury.[51]

Jeremy Renner is scheduled to portray Clint Barton / Hawkeye, a costumed hero who was trained to become a master archer by supervillains as a runaway orphan employed in a circus.[28] Renner stated that it will be a very physical role and will be training physically and practicing archery as much as possible in preparation.[52]

Scarlett Johansson,[15] and Clark Gregg,[36] are scheduled to reprise their roles from Iron Man 2 as Natasha Romanoff, and Agent Phil Coulson, respectively. Additionally, Tom Hiddleston has been cast as Loki, returning in The Avengers following 2011's Thor.[17]
