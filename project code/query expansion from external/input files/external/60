Emergency changes to the guidebook
DAILY BAG LIMIT INCREASE FOR ALL TROUT SPECIES: Ferron Reservoir (Sanpete County)— (PDF format)
The daily bag and possession limit for trout is increased to 16 trout of any species. This change is effective from July 1, 2011–January 1, 2012. Ferron Reservoir will be treated this fall as part of a native cutthroat trout restoration project. Limits are being temporarily liberalized to allow anglers to harvest trout that would otherwise be lost as a result of the treatment.
