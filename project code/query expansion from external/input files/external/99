For those of you who missed it the first time, we at ReelSEO have put together the complete list of this year's Super Bowl TV advertisers (36 total so far), along with their respective YouTube brand channels and Super Bowl teaser videos.  I watched them all and give my own awards to those that stand out from the pack.

The 2011 Super Bowl TV Advertisers, and YouTube presence

One thing I found of particular interest after putting together this list. A couple of this years's TV advertisers – Budweiser and Snickers - who have produced several commercials in years past that are regarded as part of the top 10 Super Bowl commercials ever made, still don't have their own YouTube channel
