Red light camera

A red light camera is a traffic enforcement camera which captures an image of a vehicle that illegally goes through an intersection where the light is red. Red light cameras help to enforce traffic laws by automatically photographing vehicles disobeying stop lights. The system continuously monitors the traffic signal and the camera is triggered by any vehicle entering the intersection above a preset minimum speed and following a specified time after the signal has turned red. Fines for violations in the U.S. are regulated at the State and City level and range from $50 in North Carolina to over $500 in California.[1] Many red light camera programs provide motorists with grace periods of up to half a second.[2] Depending on the particular system, a series of photographs and/or video images show the red light violator prior to entering the intersection on a red signal, as well as the vehicle's progression through the intersection. Cameras record the date, time of day, time elapsed since the beginning of the red signal, vehicle speed, and license plate. Tickets are typically mailed to owners of violating vehicles, based on review of photographic evidence.[2]


In the United States of America, a number of government-sponsored studies have addressed the question of whether, on balance, red-light cameras produce a safety benefit. A U.S. study [3], for example, found that red light cameras led to a decrease in right-angle crashes and an increase in the number of rear-end collisions. The total number of collisions remained essentially unchanged. The study applied estimates from a 1997 study of the cost of accidents based on severity to conclude the cameras yielded a positive overall cost benefit from a reduction in more expensive right-angle injury collisions.

A 2005 Virginia Department of Transportation study of the long-term effect of camera enforcement in the state found a decrease in the number of right-angle crashes, but an increase in rear-end crashes and an overall increase in the number of accidents causing injuries [4]. The report recommended further study of the issue to determine whether the severity of the eliminated red light running crashes was greater than that of the induced rear-end crashes. The department released a more extensive evaluation of the data in 2007 which showed that the overall number of accidents at intersections with red light cameras increased in four of the five cities using the technology. Fairfax City reported a 7% drop in the overall number of accidents and a 5% drop in injury accidents while overall the state's cameras were correlated with a 29% increase in overall accidents and an 18% increase in injury accidents [5]. This study also notably found that red-light violations decreased by 94% at one Fairfax County intersection, after the advent of a 1.5 second longer yellow-light phase[6].

A 2004 Texas Transportation Institute study found, "crashes decrease with an increase in yellow interval duration and a reduction in speed limit." After 1.0 second was added to the yellow signal timing at test intersections, accidents dropped by 35 to 40%. This compares with a 6.4% reduction for "area-wide officer enforcement of intersection traffic control devices... during the time of the enforcement activity" [7].

A 2005 study of the Raleigh, North Carolina red light camera program conducted by the Institute for Transportation Research and Education at North Carolina State University compared "before" and "after" red-light camera intersection data and found right-angle crashes dropped by 42 percent, rear-end crashes dropped by 25 percent and total accidents dropped by 17 percent [8].

A 2005 meta analysis compared the results of 10 controlled before-after studies of red light cameras in the United States, Australia and Singapore. "Five studies found that use of red-light cameras cut the number of crashes in which there were injuries. In the best conducted of these studies, the reduction was nearly 30%... The evidence is less conclusive on total collisions, specific casualty collision types and violations, where reductions achieved could be explained by the play of chance. Most evaluations did not adjust for RTM or spillover, affecting their accuracy. Larger and better controlled studies are needed."[9]

Usage
As of May 2009, red light cameras are used in more than 400 communities in the United States[10]. Major cities that use red light cameras include Albuquerque, Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Baton Rouge, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York City, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Raleigh, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Tucson and Washington, DC.

On November 2, 2010, four years after the original installation, Houston, Texas voted 53% to 47% against the continued use of red cameras.[11]

Some states have chosen to prohibit the use of red light cameras. These include Connecticut, Nevada, New Hampshire, West Virginia, Wisconsin,[12] and Mississippi[13] with other states, such as Louisiana considering a ban.[12] In some states such as Wisconsin, the ban comes from decisions by the state supreme court declaring that type of device unconstitutional.

Some countries in other parts of the world that use this technology extensively include Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Israel, Malta, the Netherlands, Singapore, South Africa, India, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.

Issues
While some public officials support the use of red-light cameras[14], various groups and individuals oppose them. They believe that the use of these devices raises legal issues and violates the privacy of citizens. They also question the effectiveness of red light cameras and if they really help traffic safety. In many locales, the cameras are not set up to identify the vehicle driver, raising owner liability issues[15]. However, in a few U.S. states (including California), the cameras are set up to get a "face photo" of the driver;[16]. This has been done because in those states, red light camera tickets are criminal violations, and criminal charges must always name the actual violator. In California, that need to identify the actual violator has led to the creation of a unique investigatory tool.[citation needed]

At some intersections where red light cameras have been installed, it has been determined that the duration of the yellow signal was illegally shortened[17]. In Tennessee, 176 tickets ($8,800 in fines) were refunded to drivers caught in the first 0.9 seconds after the signal turned red when it was discovered that the length of the yellow signal timing had been reduced by that amount.

Also many cities set the duration of their left turn yellow lights to 3.0 seconds regardless of the speed limit on the road. Using red light cameras, the Town of Cary, North Carolina has collected over $4,000,000.00 [18] on such lights. The Institute of Traffic Engineers declares that 3.0 seconds (given North Carolina's 1.5 perception time and 11.2 ft/s/s deceleration) is for 20 mph cars. In Cary, even 45 mph roads have left turn yellows that are 3.0 seconds. Such municipalities presume that all cars in the left lane approach the intersection at 20 mph, and thus penalize drivers for going the speed limit.

There is also an engineering application defect in the setting of all yellow light durations all around the world which cause unavoidable red light running. Most municipalities in the world use an equation derived by the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE). Departments of Transportation began to apply this equation to yellow lights in 1965. In order to use this equation properly, the equation predicates that drivers know how far the safe braking distance point is from the intersection.[19] ITE's equation demands that the driver must stop if the light turns yellow before he gets to this point. The equation demands that the driver must go if the light turns yellow after he passes this point. The problem is that no one has heard of this point let alone knows where it is. The driver has to guess. Since Departments of Transportation never reveal this location, they have created the condition of a gamble. The driver must gamble on whether to go or stop. The gamble is stacked in favor of goingâ€”to beat the light, because the equation sets the yellow light duration to half the time required to stop a car. No one can stop a car within the time the light is yellow. The logical choice is to go. Therefore drivers run the risk of running a red light over that of stopping shortly and getting rear-ended. Many times the driver accelerates to help ensure passage through the intersection while the light is still yellow. This bias to pass through the intersection to only get caught by the red light camera, in conjunction with the initial gamble, produce the statistical certainty that a large number of drivers will run the red light. Municipalities and red light camera companies bank on it. The good thing about red light cameras is that they flush out the engineering defect. In the end, this kind of defect along with all the other yellow light duration defects are all safety issues.

In some areas, red light enforcement cameras are installed and maintained by private firms such as Affiliated Computer Services[20], American Traffic Solutions, Inc.[21], and Redflex Traffic Systems[22]. Many people disagree with this privatization of a police function. In Texas, red light violators caught by a red light camera are served with a civil citation rather than a criminal citation.[23] The civil infraction (civil fine of $75, no traffic points) conflicts with the same criminal infraction (fines of $1 to $200, and traffic points). A December 2008 lawsuit against Dallas County's program[24], challenging a private camera operating company's right to hand out citations, was dismissed in March 2009.[citation needed]

Throughout the USA, red light cameras were used in 380 individual communities as of October 2008 and speed cameras were used in 45 communities plus Arizona on state roads and Illinois in work zones as of September 2008.[25] Arkansas, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin have also enacted various prohibitions on photo enforcement.[citation needed]

On February 19, 2010, Arizona completed a study of their statewide 76 photo enforcement cameras[26] and decided that they would not renew their contract with Redflex in 2011. Less than expected revenue, mixed public acceptance and mixed accident data were cited, among other findings.[27]

In New York State, red light cameras are allowed in New York City,[28] and since 2009, Nassau County, Yonkers, Buffalo, Rochester, and Suffolk County,[29][dead link]

In some U.S. jurisdictions (primarily California and Arizona), also in Sweden and Norway, the law says that the camera needs to obtain a photo of the driver's face, of sufficient quality to convince the judge that he is convicting the actual driver, not someone else who had access to the vehicle.[citation needed] Some California cities send registered owners a document that looks like a real camera ticket (but in fact has no legal weight) in an effort to get the owner to identify the driver responsible for the offense.[30]

On January 31, 2008, then New York State Assembly member Ivan Lafayette introduced New York State Assembly Bill A09877 with intent to prohibit the sale or use of a product that alerts of the presence of a red light camera under a civil penalty up to 500 USD. The memo of the bill claimed New York City's Red-Light Camera Program to be a revenue-neutral success to reduce the running of red lights and improve safety. It was referred to consumer affairs and protection on the same day.[31]
