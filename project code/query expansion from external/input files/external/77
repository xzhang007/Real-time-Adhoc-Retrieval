NCIS (TV series)

NCIS, formerly known as NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service, is an American police procedural drama television series revolving around a fictional team of special agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, which conducts criminal investigations involving the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps.

The concept and characters were initially introduced in a two-part episode of the CBS series JAG (JAG episodes 8.20 and 8.21). The show, a spin-off from JAG, premiered on September 23, 2003 on CBS and, to date, has aired seven full seasons and has gone into syndicated reruns on USA Network, Sleuth and Ion Television. Donald Bellisario, who created JAG as well as the well-known series Magnum, P.I. and Quantum Leap, is co-creator and executive producer of NCIS.

NCIS was originally referred to as Navy NCIS during Season 1; however, "Navy" was later dropped from the title as it was redundant. NCIS was joined in its seventh season by a spin-off series, NCIS: Los Angeles, starring Chris O'Donnell and LL Cool J.

On February 1, 2011 the series picked up its highest ratings to date, with the thirteenth episode of the eighth season drawing 22.85 million viewers.[1][2]

On February 2, 2011 NCIS was renewed by CBS for a ninth season.[3][4]

NCIS follows a fictional team of Naval Criminal Investigative Service Major Case Response Team (MCRT) special agents headquartered at the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C. It is described by the actors and producers (on special features on DVD releases in the United States) as being distinguished by its comic elements, ensemble acting and character-driven plots.

NCIS is the primary law enforcement and counter-intelligence arm of the United States Department of the Navy, which includes the United States Marine Corps. NCIS investigates all major criminal offenses (felonies)—crimes punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice by confinement of more than one year—within the Department of the Navy. The MCRT is frequently assigned to high profile cases such as the death of the U.S. president's military aide, a bomb situation on a U.S. Navy warship, the death of a celebrity on a reality show set on a USMC base, terrorist threats, and kidnappings.

The MCRT is led by Supervisory Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon). Gibbs’s team is composed of Special Agent and Senior Field Agent Anthony "Tony" DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly), Special Agent Timothy McGee (Sean Murray) and Probationary Special Agent (formerly Mossad liaison officer) Ziva David (Cote de Pablo), who replaced Caitlin "Kate" Todd (Sasha Alexander) when she was shot by Ari Haswari (Rudolf Martin) at the end of season two. Ari was then killed by his half-sister Ziva at the beginning of season three. The team is assisted in their investigations by Chief Medical Examiner Donald "Ducky" Mallard (David McCallum), his assistant Jimmy Palmer (Brian Dietzen), who replaced Gerald Jackson (Pancho Demmings), and Forensic Specialist Abigail "Abby" Sciuto (Pauley Perrette).

It has been revealed through flashbacks that the 'original' head of the MCRT was Special Agent Mike Franks, who led the unit when it was part of the Naval Investigative Service (NIS), the predecessor agency of the NCIS. He recruited Gibbs shortly after Gibbs' retirement from the Marine Corps, eventually retiring himself some years later. After Franks' departure, Gibbs recruited DiNozzo from the Baltimore Police Department's Homicide Section. The two were briefly joined by Vivian Blackadder, whom Gibbs recruited from the FBI. In the second part of the NCIS pilot, Blackadder allowed her emotions to nearly derail an anti-terror operation in Spain. Gibbs is noticeably disappointed; Blackadder is not present in the series' first regular episode, replaced by Caitlin Todd, a Secret Service agent who joins Gibbs' team after resigning from the Secret Service. McGee first appears as a Field Agent assigned to the Norfolk Field Office. He uses his computer skills to aid the MCRT in subsequent investigations through the rest of the first season, until he is officially promoted with his own desk at the Navy Yard in the beginning of the second season.

NCIS is currently led by Director Leon Vance (Rocky Carroll). The first director seen in the series, Thomas Morrow (Alan Dale), left after being promoted to Deputy Director of DHS. Jenny Shepard (Lauren Holly) was appointed director after Morrow; she was killed in a shootout at the end of the fifth season, thus making Vance the director of the entire organization.

Name
Prior to the launch of the first season, advertisements on CBS identified the show as "Naval CIS". By the time of the launch of the first episode, NCIS was airing under the name Navy NCIS, the name it held for the entire first season. Since the "N" in NCIS stands for "Naval", the name Navy NCIS was technically redundant. The decision to use this name was reportedly made by CBS, over the objections of Bellisario, in order to:

Attract new viewers (particularly those of JAG), who might not know the NCIS abbreviation.
Disambiguate between NCIS and the similarly-themed and similarly-spelled CBS series CSI and its spinoffs. (The original title, for instance, was often misquoted and parodied as "Navy CSI", something the show itself referenced in the first episode).[9]
After its successful first season, the name of the series was shortened to NCIS.

Filming location
NCIS is set in the Washington, D.C., area but is filmed in Santa Clarita, California.[10] The sound stages are in Santa Clarita. The series is shot throughout southern California.

Crew changes
It was reported in May 2007 that Donald Bellisario would be stepping down from the show.[11] Due to a disagreement with series star Mark Harmon, Bellisario's duties as show runner/head writer were to be tasked to long-time show collaborators, including co-executive producer Chas. Floyd Johnson and Shane Brennan, with Bellisario retaining his title as executive producer.[12]

Crossovers
NCIS has had crossovers with two other CBS shows:

JAG: The pilot of NCIS was made up of two episodes of JAG, "Ice Queen" and "Meltdown" from JAG's eighth season. These JAG episodes introduced Mark Harmon as Gibbs, Michael Weatherly as Tony, Pauley Perrette as Abby, and David McCallum as Ducky. Patrick Labyorteaux reprised his role as Lt. Bud Roberts in the first season episode "Hung Out to Dry", while Alicia Coppola and Adam Baldwin reprised their JAG roles in "Hometown Hero" and "A Weak Link" respectively.
NCIS: Los Angeles: Rocky Carroll appears on NCIS: Los Angeles as his NCIS character Director Leon Vance, while Pauley Perrette has appeared twice as Abby. Also, on the season finale of NCIS: Los Angeles, David Dayan Fisher reprises his role as CIA Officer Trent Kort. Additionally, Kelly Hu appears as Lee Wuan Kai in NCIS: Los Angeles and later appears in an episode of NCIS. Also, many of the characters working at the Office of Special Operations in NCIS: Los Angeles are introduced near the end of Season 6 of NCIS. In the Season 7 finale of NCIS, Vance mentions he has spent a lot of time getting the new Los Angeles branch up and running the past year, and tells Gibbs that Hetty took him on a tour of Warner Bros. Studios.
