List of ships attacked by Somali pirates

Piracy off the Somali coast has threatened international shipping since the beginning of Somalia's civil war in the early 1990s.[1] Since 2005, though, pirates have threatened and seized many ships. A list of ships attacked by Somali pirates since that time is catalogued. Since 2005, many international organizations, including the International Maritime Organization and the World Food Programme, have expressed concern over the rise in acts of piracy.[2] Piracy has contributed to a rise in shipping costs and shipping insurance premiums,[3] and impeded the delivery of food aid shipments.

The UN Security Council adopted a resolution on November 20, 2008, proposed by Britain, introducing tougher sanctions against Somalia over the country's failure to prevent a surge in sea piracy.[4] The Somali government is struggling for control of the country against an Islamic insurgency and its navy is currently in development, leaving it almost powerless to stop piracy.

An Indian Coast Guard aircraft while responding to a distress call from the CMA CGM Verdi, located two skiffs attempting a piracy attack near Lakshadweep. Seeing the aircraft, the skiffs immediately aborted their piracy attempt and dashed towards the mother vessel, MV Prantalay - a hijacked Thai trawler, which hurriedly hoisted the two skiffs onboard and moved westward. The Indian Navy deployed the INS Cankarso which located and engaged the mothership 100 nautical miles north of the Minicoy island. 10 pirates were killed while 15 were apprehended and 20 Thai and Myanmar fishermen being held aboard the ship as hostages were rescued. INS Cankarso was subsequently joined by the INS Kalpeni of the Indian Navy and CGS Sankalp of the Indian Coast Guard. The rescued fishermen were sent to Kochi while the 15 pirates, mostly Somali, have been taken to Mumbai. Mumbai Police have confirmed that they have registered a case against the pirates for attempt to murder and various other provisions under the Indian Penal Code and Foreigners Act for entering the Indian waters without permission.[13]
