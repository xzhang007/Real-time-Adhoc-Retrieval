The Stock Market
Tutorial

It's very tempting, and it does sound great - to be able to make money every day investing in the stock market.

But how the electronic stock market tutorial in investing and trading is sold to the public is an ugly story. No one you talk to about this will admit it!

No surprise there!

But you can always count on us to shed light on the truth behind the myth, that will prevent you from losing all your hard earned money!

Brokerage firms decided to set up marketing companies that would offer the ability to set up offices and make money by advertising that you can now use online stock market tutorials, investing education and trading systems from their offices or your home in your community and they would make a small fee every time you execute a trade.

Most of the people that would operate offices know absolutely nothing about stock market tutorials and trading and even less about economics.

They would hire some guy to teach the aspiring traders how to use the electronic online stock market tutorial and trading system.

The guy teaching in most cases never even traded before in his life, or had no experience trading and probably never even set foot in a real trading department of a brokerage firm.

The result is a disastrous combination of the inexperienced, incompetent managers and teachers instructing inexperienced aspiring traders!

The truth of the matter is that most people are not successful trading in this environment. Not because online trading "doesn't work," but because they're not taught how to do it properly!

The people that are operating these offices expected it to be as simple as running a coffee shop.

They had what I call a casino mentality!

They thought that all they had to do was open an office and people would beat down their door to get in. They didn't realize that if people lost money they would quit stock trading.

The owners of the offices were not equipped to continually train the traders and offer support and on-going advice to insure the traders success.

See, in the beginning it was very simple. While watching a screen, as soon as you saw offers fading you would obtain an execution at the offer, then simply sell the stock when it traded up a certain percentage. That worked like shooting fish in a barrel when there was only about 500 guys trading back in the early days.

Now you have 10000 or more guys trying to trade that last offer before the stock goes up!

Market makers are very shrewd cats. They know how to trade against the other traders and take advantage of their weaknesses (which is immediately selling the stock they bought if it doesn't go up).

Now, really ... Who is the idiot?

Remember, when you buy or sell, somebody is on the other side of the trade ...

Do you really think that you know more than this other person?
