Is the Health Care Law Unconstitutional?

Just minutes after President Obama signed the health care legislation into law on Tuesday, 13 state attorneys general, led by Bill McCollum of Florida, filed a federal lawsuit challenging the law’s constitutionality. Virginia’s attorney general, Kenneth Cuccinelli, filed a similar suit the same day. Both complaints charge that Congress has no power under the Constitution’s Commerce Clause to require that all Americans buy health insurance or pay a penalty.

Do the opponents have a strong case that the individual mandate is unconstitutional? How likely are the courts to strike down any part of the health legislation?

A Tax Like Any Other
Jack M. Balkin
Jack M. Balkin is Knight Professor of Constitutional Law and the First Amendment at Yale Law School. His latest book, with Reva B. Siegel, is “The Constitution in 2020.” He participated in a discussion on this issue in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review.

The individual mandate, which amends the Internal Revenue Code, is not actually a mandate at all. It is a tax. It gives people a choice: they can buy health insurance or they can pay a tax roughly equal to the cost of health insurance, which is used to subsidize the government’s health care program and families who wish to purchase health insurance.

What the opponents are really claiming is that it is unconstitutional to make Americans pay taxes.
People are exempt from the tax if they get health insurance through their employer or through Medicare, are poor, are dependents, are in the military, live overseas, or have a religious objection.

The new law keeps insurance companies from denying coverage because of preexisting conditions or from imposing lifetime caps on coverage. The individual mandate makes these popular aspects of health care reform possible.

Exceeding Congress’s Authority
Randy Barnett
Randy Barnett is the Carmack Waterhouse Professor of Legal Theory at Georgetown Law Center and author of “Restoring the Lost Constitution: The Presumption of Liberty.”

The smart money is always on the Supreme Court upholding an act of Congress. And the smart money is right until the day it is wrong — as when constitutional law professors confidently predicted the court would uphold the Gun Free School Zones Act in 1995 and the Violence Against Women Act in 2000.

The professoriate was shocked when both laws were held unconstitutional because they exceeded Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause.

The Supreme Court has never upheld a “tax” penalizing private citizens who refuse to enter into a contract with a private company.
The individual mandate goes far beyond these previous acts. Congress has never before mandated that a citizen enter into an economic transaction with a private company, so there can be no judicial precedent for such a law. Telling someone how they must do something is one thing; commanding that they must do something is entirely different.

Imagine if Congress ordered the majority of American households without a firearm to buy a handgun from a private company, and punished their failure to do so with an escalating monetary fine, which it labeled a “tax.” Would the supporters of the health insurance mandate feel the same about the constitutionality of such a measure?

The 10th Amendment Question
Abbe R. Gluck
Abbe R. Gluck is an associate professor at Columbia Law School, where she focuses on legislation, health law, and federalism. She previously served as the Special Counsel and Senior Adviser to the New Jersey Attorney General.

I agree with the many scholars who have ably rebutted the claim made by the state attorneys general that Congress lacks the power, under Article I of the Constitution, to require individuals to purchase health insurance or face a tax. Congress unquestionably has the power to tax for the general welfare and regulate activity that affects interstate commerce, and it should be beyond dispute that health care (as well as the failure to have it) affects the national economy.

Any state that does not want to expand Medicaid can simply drop the program entirely.
But there is another refutable point in the lawsuit that has not received as much attention, and which I’d like to focus on — namely, the argument that the 10th Amendment prevents the federal government from forcing states to expand their Medicaid programs.

This argument is based on the so-called “anti-commandeering” principle, which the Supreme Court has said prohibits the federal government from compelling state officers to carry out federal programs that affect state sovereignty. The suit also appears to be claiming that the legislation imposes coercive conditions on the states’ receipt of federal funds.

Going Off the Rails
David RivkinLee Casey
David B. Rivkin and Lee A. Casey are partners at Baker & Hostetler LLP. They are counsel in the suit, Florida, et al., v. United States Department of Health and Human Service. They argued against the individual mandate in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review.

The recently passed health care law is an unprecedented expansion of federal power at the expense of the states and the American people. Its provisions go far beyond any legitimate exercise of constitutional authority vested in Congress.

If Congress can legislate this broadly, then there is no limit to federal power in every aspect of life.
This is true of the law’s imposition of vast new regulatory and administrative costs and burdens on the states, and of a health insurance mandate on individuals.

The requirement that all Americans obtain health insurance coverage is a central component of the new law. The mandate applies regardless of whether an individual is engaged in any conduct or activity that Congress can regulate under the Commerce Clause, or any of its other constitutional sources of legislative power. The mandate is, in fact, a quintessential “police power” exercise — a law requiring or forbidding individual action enacted simply because lawmakers consider the measure to be in the public interest.

A Permissible Exercise of Power
James Blumstein
James F. Blumstein is University Professor of Constitutional Law and Health Law & Policy at Vanderbilt Law School.

The states’ constitutional challenges to health reform are serious and should not be treated dismissively. But given the expansion of federal power since 1937, one should review the states’ claims with some healthy skepticism. For the states to succeed in having the law declared unconstitutional, the Supreme Court would have to modify significantly existing analysis and doctrine surrounding the Commerce Clause.

The Supreme Court would have to modify Commerce Clause doctrine significantly to find the health law unconstitutional.
It is fair, however, to ask whether the required purchase of insurance is a regulation of commerce. Previous cases have all involved negative prohibitions on private conduct, such as restrictions on growing wheat for home consumption and on growing and using marijuana for medical purposes. Is the affirmative mandate substantially different from a negative prohibition? In the abstract, perhaps, but Congress can enact legislation that is necessary and proper for implementing permissible legislation.

A cornerstone of health reform is the requirement that insurance companies accept persons with preexisting medical conditions (“guaranteed issue”). But standing alone, this principle would create a death spiral for insurance because those with preexisting conditions are expensive to cover (they are likely to cost more than the premiums they contribute) and are more likely to seek coverage because they know they need health care.
