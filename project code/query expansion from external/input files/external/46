Bottega Veneta
Bottega Veneta is an Italian luxury goods house best known for its leather goods. Founded in 1966, it was purchased in 2001 by Gucci Group, now a part of the French multinational group PPR. Bottega Veneta is headquartered in Vicenza, in the Veneto region of northeastern Italy.

Bottega Veneta was established in 1966 by Michele Taddei and Renzo Zengiaro. The name Bottega Veneta means “Venetian atelier” and the company was begun to produce artisanal leather goods. The company’s artisans developed a leather-weaving technique, called intrecciato, that remains a signature of the brand.

Over time Bottega Veneta’s renown grew, thanks to the quality of its craftsmanship and the appeal of its discreet, no-logo design. In the 1970s the company began advertising with the tag line “When your own initials are enough”. By the early 1980s Bottega Veneta was a favorite of the international jet set. Andy Warhol, who did his Christmas shopping in the New York boutique, made a short film for the company in 1980s. Renzo Zengiaro left Bottega Veneta in the late 1970s. Michele Taddei departed a few years later. Vittorio and Laura Moltedo (Laura had previously been married to Taddei) moved from New York to Vicenza to run the company. Over time, Bottega Veneta’s fortunes declined and by the 1990s the brand had abandoned its understated ethos and ventured into more trend-driven fashion territory.

The most recent chapter in Bottega Veneta’s history began in February 2001, when the company was acquired by Gucci Group. Creative Director Tomas Maier came on board in June of that year. and presented his first collection, for Spring-Summer 2002, that fall. The German-born Maier, whose resumé includes positions at Sonia Rykiel and Hermès, set about returning the brand to its original identity. He removed visible logos from the brand’s products, highlighted the signature intrecciato weave prominently, and returned the company’s focus to artisanal production.

In the years since, Bottega Veneta has introduced additions to the collection, including fine jewelry, eyewear, home fragrance, and furniture, while continuing to offer an assortment of handbags, shoes, small leather goods, luggage, home items, and gifts. Bottega Veneta presented its first women’s ready-to-wear runway show in February 2005 and its first men’s runway show in June 2006. Today, ready-to-wear and furniture presentations are held in the corporate offices in Milan.

In the summer of 2006, in recognition of the importance of artisanal craftsmanship and the diminishing number of master leatherworkers in Italy, Bottega Veneta opened the Scuola della Pelletteria, a school to train and support future generations of leather artisans.
