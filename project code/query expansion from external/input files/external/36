Domodedovo International Airport bombing


The 2011 Domodedovo International Airport bombing was a suspected suicide attack that occurred at Domodedovo International Airport outside Moscow, on 24 January 2011. The bombing killed at least 35 people and injured at least 152, of which 64 had to be hospitalised.[2][3][4][5][6][7] Of the casualties, 31 died in the airport, 3 in hospitals and 1 in an ambulance.[8]

The explosion affected the baggage reclaim area of the international arrivals hall of the airport terminal.[1] Some reports have suggested that the explosion was the work of a suicide bomber, with investigators saying the explosion was caused by an "improvised device packed with shrapnel, pieces of chopped wire" and the equivalent to between 2 and 5 kg of TNT; police are searching for three male suspects.[9][10] Russia's chief investigator has stated the explosion was the work of terrorists.[4] Investigators have found a human male head and currently believe it might have been the suicide bomber's.[10][11]

The airport is located 40 kilometres (25 mi) outside the centre of Moscow and is heavily used by foreign workers and tourists.[4] The blast was followed by a drop of almost two percent at the Moscow stock exchange (MICEX).[1] After the bombing, Russian president Dmitry Medvedev announced that he would delay his departure to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.[10]
