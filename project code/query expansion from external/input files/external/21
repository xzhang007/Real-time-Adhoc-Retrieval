Rahm Emanuel Supreme Court Decision: Can Run For Chicago Mayor, Residency Is Valid

CHICAGO — Illinois’ highest court put Rahm Emanuel back in the race for Chicago mayor Thursday, three days after a lower court threw the former White House chief of staff off the ballot because he had not lived in the city for a full year.

The state Supreme Court ruled unanimously in Emanuel’s favor, saying an appeals court decision that said the candidate needed to be physically present in Chicago was “without any foundation in Illinois law.”

“As I said from the beginning, I think the voters deserve the right to make the choice of who should be mayor,” Emanuel said shortly after getting word of the high court’s action. “I’m not quite sure emotionally where I’m at.”

When he learned of the ruling, Emanuel said he immediately called his wife and took a congratulatory call from his old boss, President Barack Obama.

In a 7-0 decision, the Illinois Supreme Court called the appellate court’s Monday decision “fundamentally flawed” and said the judges were not “justified in tossing out 150 years of settled residency law in favor of its own preferred standard.” (Read the Supreme Court decision here.)

From Thursday’s ruling (emphasis added):

Although adopting a previously unheard-of test for residency that would have applied to all future municipal elections, the court made no attempt to explain what its standard means. The only hint given by the appellate court is that, whatever its standard means, this candidate did not satisfy it. The appellate court never explained what it meant by “actually reside” or “actually live.” Indeed, as its discussion of section 3.1-10-5(d) reflects, the entire appellate court opinion can be read as nothing more than an extended exercise in
question begging, in which the appellate court sets forth the question to be answered as what it means to “reside” (No. 1-11-0033, slip op. at 11), and concludes that it means to have “actually resided” (No. 1-11-0033, slip op. at 21). “
Emanuel, who has said he always intended to return to Chicago and was only living in Washington at the request of the president, had asked the Supreme Court to overturn the appeals court ruling. Within minutes of the ruling, Emanuel was at a downtown Chicago public transit station shaking hands with residents.

He never stopped campaigning as the controversy evolved. His spokesman said Emanuel was en route to the campaign appearance when he received word of the ruling and was scheduled to participate in televised debate Thursday evening.

In their appeal, Emanuel’s attorneys called Monday’s appeal court ruling “one of the most far-reaching election law rulings” ever issued in Illinois, not only because of its effect on the mayoral race but for “the unprecedented restriction” it puts on future candidates. (Read the appellate court decision here.)

His lawyers raised several points, including that the appeals court applied a stricter definition of “residency” than the one used for voters. They say Illinois courts have never required candidates to be physically present in the state to seek office there.

Emanuel, who has been leading all of his opponents in fundraising and in polls, was confident that the Supreme Court would reverse Monday’s decision.

“I am clear that I think that we will succeed because of the thoroughness of our argument,” he said Tuesday at an event where he received an endorsement from the Teamsters. He said he was “more determined to see this through so the people have a right to make the choice for themselves.”

The residency questions have dogged Emanuel ever since he announced his candidacy last fall. Emanuel tried to move back into his house when he returned to Chicago but the family renting it wanted $100,000 to break the lease and move out early. The tenant, businessman Rob Halpin, later filed paperwork to run for mayor against Emanuel, only to withdraw from the race a short time later.

The Supreme Court was also impressed with Emanuel’s testimony before the city’s election board in which he listed all the personal items in the house he rented in Chicago when he moved to Washington - including his wife’s wedding dress, photographs of his children and clothes they wore from the hospital as well as items belonging to his grandfather.

“The Board determined that, in this situation, the rental did not show abandonment of the residence,” the court wrote. “This conclusion was well supported by the evidence and was not clearly erroneous.”

More than two dozen people testified on the residency issue at a Chicago Board of Elections hearing in December. The three-day hearing got progressively stranger as attorneys gave way to Chicago residents who filed objections to his candidacy, including one man who asked Emanuel if he caused the 1993 siege at Waco, Texas.

The Chicago Board of Election Commissioners and a Cook County judge have previously both ruled in favor of Emanuel, a former congressman, saying he didn’t abandon his Chicago residency when he went to work at the White House.

Before Thursday’s ruling, a lot of pressure was put on the Illinois Supreme Court. Though some voters and politicians believe the appellate court’s decision was the right one, the majority seemed to be in favor of Emanuel being able to run for mayor.

Former Republican governor James Thompson and attorneys general Tyrone Fahner and James Ryan wrote a letter to the State Journal-Register this week, calling the appellate court’s decision “perverse” and urging the Supreme Court to “correct this error.” NBC Chicago shared a portion of the letter Thursday:

For 144 years, Illinois law has been clear: a resident who leaves the state temporarily with an intent to return does not lose his status as a resident. However, the appellate court made a dramatic departure from this principle. It adopted a brand new standard, holding that to be a “resident” for purposes of the municipal code, one must physically live here, and that even absence as a public servant does not preserve one’s residence.
Under this standard, Abraham Lincoln, Barack Obama and Adlai Stevenson each ceased being “residents” when they left to serve our country.
Justice Bertina Lampkin, in dissent, called this “a new and undefined standard for determining candidate residency requirements despite the plethora of clear, relevant and well-established precedent that has been used by our circuit courts and election boards for decades.”
We agree. We fear that the appellate court’s decision has the perverse effect of punishing Mr. Emanuel for his service to our country. And we hope that the Illinois Supreme Court will correct this error and find Mr. Emanuel to be a resident for the purpose of his candidacy for mayor of Chicago.
Emanuel joined former U.S. Sen. Carol Moseley Braun, former Chicago Board of Education President Gery Chico and City Clerk Miguel del Valle in a televised debate following Thursday’s ruling.

“I have banned the word ‘resident’ in Scrabble in our household,” Emanuel said Thursday night. “I never want to see it again. Even if you get it on a triple word, you’re not allowed to use it.”

Statement From Chicago Board Of Elections:
Statement of Langdon D. Neal, Chairman of the Chicago Election Board: “The printing has moved ahead steadily, working all three shifts since Tuesday. We are well into the process with more than 1 million ballots printed.” “It’s good to have certainty in the citywide contests launch Early Voting at all 51 sites and start processing absentee-ballot applications on Monday.” “We will be giving voters from about 10 wards notices that there are court cases pending in certain aldermanic contests. These notices will remind the voters that they may vote now or vote later, but once they cast a ballot, there are no do-overs. Under the law, voters cannot return to change their votes for any reason.”

Obama Calls Rahm
Rahm Emanuel told a group of reporters Thursday that he received a call of support from President Obama following the Supreme Court’s decision.

“Entirely Clear”
More from the Court’s ruling:

So there will be no mistake, let us be entirely clear. This court’s decision is based on the following and only on the following: (1) what it means to be a resident for election purposes was clearly established long ago, and Illinois law has been consistent on the matter since at least the 19th Century; (2) the novel standard adopted by the appellate court majority is without any foundation in Illinois law; (3) the Board’s factual findings were not against the manifest weight of the evidence; and (4) the Board’s decision was not clearly erroneous.
Two justices concurred “specially,” meaning they filed their own opinion agreeing with the ruling but disagreeing with the reasoning. “The result in this case is in no way as clear-cut as the majority makes it out to be,” Justices Freeman and Burke write.

Heading To The “L”
The Emanuel camp is setting up an impromptu appearance for the candidate at a downtown “L” stop. From a campaign email:

Mayoral candidate Rahm Emanuel will appear at the Clark/Lake L stop. 5:15 PM CST Clark/Lake L Stop (lower level) 100/124 West Lake Street Chicago, IL OPEN PRESS*
We’re guessing he might be running a little late, but we doubt that’ll bother him too much.

Rahm Wins, Convincingly
“Appellate court judgment reversed; circuit court judgment affirmed.”

With those eight words, the Illinois Supreme Court ended a week of drama (dare we say “dRahma”?) surrounding the Emanuel campaign for Chicago mayor.

All seven justices on the Court voted to overturn the ruling kicking him off the ballot. The unanimous decision is a tremendous boon to Rahm’s campaign, and sure makes those two appellate court judges look a bit foolish.

Victory in hand, Rahm will now concentrate on the mayoral debate, which starts in less than two hours.

Oh Lord...
From Rich Miller at the Capitol Fax:

4:44 pm - I’m hearing the Rahm Emanuel decision is going to be handed down any minute now.
4:46 pm - Maybe not. Just talked with the Supreme Court again. Hang loose, but don’t stray far.

Less Than Three Hours To The Debate...
...and unless there’s word from the Court before then, Rahm will be there.

Details on the debate: it’ll air at 7 p.m. Central time tonight, on WGN-TV and streaming live at this link. All four “major” mayoral candidates will be there: Emanuel, Gery Chico, Miguel del Valle, and Carol Moseley Braun. Two others, Patricia Watkins and Dock Walls, polled below 5 percent and weren’t invited. Hosts are the Chicago Tribune and the City Club of Chicago; moderators will be Micah Matierre and Bruce Dold.

It’ll be interesting to see how the residency issue plays out. Unless he gets a big win beforehand, we imagine Rahm will steer clear from it. Or will he take the bull by the horns? Will one of his opponents take a shot at him on it? Either way, should be good television.
